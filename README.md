## 🌟 Task Descriptions
### 1. Image Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Implement a KNN classifier to predict class labels for a given dataset.

**Tasks:**

- Train a KNN model on Iris dataset
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
- Classify new, unlabeled images into predefined categories.
  
### 2. Movie Recommendation System
Build a movie recommendation system using cosine-similarity

**Tasks:**

- Preprocess text data.
- Train the model.
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

### 3.  Text Classification using Naive Bayes
Build a text classifier using the Naive Bayes algorithm for 20Newsgroup Dataset.

**Tasks:**

- Preprocess text data.
- Train a Naive Bayes model.
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
